Introduction
============

This is a redesign and reimplementation of GAMIL dynamical core (shortly as
dycore) developed in IAP/LASG. New dycore should be devised with the following
considerations ordered by priority from high to low:

- Switch between hydrostatic and nonhydrostatic (e.g. hydrostatic-pressure coordinate)
- Better vertical coordinate (e.g. SLEVE)
- Nonhydrostatic (e.g. filter vertical acoustic wave or implicit solver)
- Deep atmosphere
- Good extendability
